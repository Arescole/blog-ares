                    <p class="title-text">On the first day of my internship, I focused on observing the office environment and understanding workplace dynamics. I took note of how the team communicated, how tasks were assigned, and how departments coordinated to meet their goals. Learning about the tools and software they used was a priority, as they were integral to operations. I also observed the office culture, from professional etiquette to problem-solving approaches. By the end of the day, I felt more comfortable and ready to transition from an observer to an active participant, preparing for the tasks ahead.</p>

                    <p class="title-text">On day 2, I took a more active role in the office, with the primary task being testing computers in the session hall alongside my team. We checked each system, noting any issues and ensuring everything was operational. This hands-on work sharpened my troubleshooting skills and emphasized the importance of teamwork. We divided tasks, communicated effectively, and double-checked our work to ensure nothing was missed. I gained a clearer understanding of the office’s technology infrastructure and maintenance protocols. By the end of the day, I felt more involved, shifting from observation to active problem-solving, which set the stage for future challenges.

                        On the third day of my internship, we continued testing the computers in the session hall, but with more in-depth hardware checks and the added task of formatting operating systems. This required precision, as we ensured each system was not only functional but also properly configured. I inspected internal components for issues and documented any problems, collaborating with my team to resolve them. Formatting the OS was especially engaging, as it involved wiping systems and installing fresh ones with great attention to detail. By the end of the day, I felt accomplished, having deepened both my hardware and software skills.

                    <p class="title-text">On the fourth day of my internship, I shifted my focus towards document management by starting the process of segregating printed resolutions for the entire province of Surigao del Sur. This task required a methodical approach, as I had to carefully sort through stacks of resolutions, ensuring that each document was placed in the correct category. The sheer volume of paperwork was daunting, but I steadily worked my way through it. I found this experience insightful, 
                        as it gave me a deeper understanding of the legislative process and how resolutions are organized for reference. The task also honed my organizational skills, as I had to develop an efficient system to categorize the resolutions for easier access later on. By the end of the day, I had made significant progress, setting the groundwork for the next few days of document sorting.</p>

This step involved a more detailed review of the documents, as I had to carefully check the dates and arrange them in chronological order. The challenge here was ensuring that no document was misplaced, which required a great deal of focus and precision. 
                        I also worked closely with my team to ensure that we were all following the same system of organization. By the end of the day, we had successfully organized a large portion of the resolutions, which made me feel accomplished. This process also reinforced the importance of attention to detail in document management tasks.</p>

                    <p class="title-text">Day 6 involved organizing all of the previously segregated resolutions by their assigned codes and corresponding years. This was a meticulous task, as each resolution had to be cross-referenced with its code and year to ensure accuracy. Once organized, we archived the documents accordingly, placing them in storage for future reference. This process was vital for maintaining the integrity of the records, ensuring that they could be easily retrieved when needed. 
                        The archiving portion of the task provided me with valuable insight into how large-scale documentation is handled in government offices. At the end of the day, I felt a sense of fulfillment as we had completed a significant part of the document management project, making the resolution archive more accessible and structured.</p>

In the afternoon, I participated in a committee meeting, where I was able to contribute to the setup and support tasks. This exposure to formal government proceedings was both informative and eye-opening, as it provided me with a better understanding of the legislative environment in which I was working. 
                        I felt that my role in supporting these sessions was meaningful, and I learned a great deal about how government functions at a local level.</p>

This task required a lot of attention to detail, as poorly managed cables could cause connectivity issues or create a cluttered workspace. I made sure to carefully test each printer to ensure that it was functioning properly and cleaned them to prevent any issues with print quality. The cable management aspect was particularly satisfying, as I enjoy organizing equipment in a way that is both efficient and visually clean. 
                        By the end of the day, the printers were fully operational, and the cables were neatly managed, contributing to a more organized and functional office environment.</p>

                    <p class="title-text">On Day 19, I took on the responsibility of arranging the general records for the entire province. This task involved sorting and categorizing a large volume of records, ensuring that they were organized in a way that would make them easy to retrieve when needed. I worked closely with my team to develop an efficient system for cataloging the records, which required a lot of focus and precision. This task gave me valuable insight into how important it is to have a well-organized record-keeping system, especially in a government office where documentation is critical for legal and administrative purposes. 
                        By the end of the day, we had made significant progress in organizing the records, and I felt a sense of accomplishment in contributing to this important task.</p>

                    <p class="title-text">Day 20 was another session day as I assisted in the 102nd Regular Session in the morning. Similar to previous sessions, I was involved in setting up and ensuring that all necessary equipment was ready for the meeting. I also provided support during the session, helping with any logistical tasks that arose. In the afternoon, I attended a committee meeting where I assisted with note-taking and ensuring that all documents were properly organized for reference during the discussion. This day reinforced my understanding of the structure and flow of government meetings and the critical role that administrative support plays in ensuring that these sessions run smoothly. 
                        By the end of the day, I had gained more confidence in handling the tasks associated with government sessions.</p>

This system is used to track the progress of various legislative resolutions and other important documents within the office. My role was to help ensure that the system was functioning properly and to assist with any technical issues that arose during the orientation. This experience allowed me to get a deeper understanding of how technology is used in the legislative process, particularly in terms of document management and workflow optimization. 
                        I found it fascinating to see how a well-organized tracking system can streamline processes and make the management of legislative documents much more efficient. By the end of the day, I felt more confident in my ability to assist with the technical aspects of the system.</p>

I collaborated with my team to make sure that everything was in order, double-checking our work to ensure accuracy. This task required a lot of patience and attention to detail, but it also gave me a chance to contribute to the long-term organization of the office’s records.

I also began preparing for the final day of my OJT by returning and arranging the materials we had used throughout the internship. This included organizing the physical equipment, such as computers and printers, as well as ensuring that all documents and files were properly archived. The day was bittersweet as I reflected on my entire internship experience, but it was also satisfying to wrap up the remaining tasks and leave everything in order for the next group of interns. 
                        By the end of the day, I felt a sense of closure and accomplishment, knowing that I had completed my internship with a strong work ethic and valuable experiences.</p>
